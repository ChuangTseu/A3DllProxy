Put the A3DllProxy Dll in any mod folder where you wan't to run your extension tests.

To attach your own Dll, put it in the exact same folder where A3DllProxy.dll is.


You MUST export the _RVExtension_Dev@12 symbol as in the exemple below :

extern "C" {
	__declspec (dllexport) void __stdcall RVExtension_Dev(char *output, int outputSize, const char *function);
}


You MUST ABSOLUTLY NOT export the standard _RVExtension@12 symbol, otherwise Arma 3 might use your Dll rather than the A3DllProxy Dll and you won't be able to use its live reloading capacities.


USAGE :


To detach DLL : 
	"A3DllProxy" callExtension "-a3dllproxy d"
	or
	"A3DllProxy" callExtension "-a3dllproxy detach"

To attach DLL : 
	"A3DllProxy" callExtension "-a3dllproxy a"
	or
	"A3DllProxy" callExtension "-a3dllproxy attach"

To reload DLL (useless) : 
	"A3DllProxy" callExtension "-a3dllproxy r"
	or
	"A3DllProxy" callExtension "-a3dllproxy reload"

To see version (useless) : 
	"A3DllProxy" callExtension "-a3dllproxy v"
	or
	"A3DllProxy" callExtension "-a3dllproxy version"


Anything else will just be forwarded as is to your custom DLL.
